This vignette shows how to perform a single period arithmetic attribution analysis on a multi-currency portfolio using the the `PortfolioAttribution` package with two different approaches. For more details please refer to the [introduction vignette](introduction.html) and the [multi-currency introduction vignette](introduction-multi-currency.html).
